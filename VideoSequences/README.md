## Access to Inferred Results through Video Sequences

A contribution from the thesis is the aggregation of the inferred frames from the various methods in video sequences. This is in order to achieve an increased intuitive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the invrestigated approaches.

**The videos are available at the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CoUF1gIpiB3AeQx9zpSNoo_agPWRX-3Q?usp=sharing).**

For each method, the results at each flight are provided.

*The video sequences are too large to fit in the current repository; however, they should be able to be inspected within the browser.*
